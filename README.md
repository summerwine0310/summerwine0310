On the backend, I specialize in Node.js, Python, and Java, and Iâ€™m skilled in both SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL and MongoDB.

I have experience with CMS platforms like WordPress and Drupal.

In DevOps, Iâ€™ve set up CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and Iâ€™m proficient with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud deployments on AWS and Azure.
